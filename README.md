### üôè Credits & Development

This enhanced version builds upon the foundation created by [muctebanesiri](https://github.com/muctebanesiri), whose original multiple choice template provided the starting point for these improvements. The original code foundation was initially provided/modified by u/12yardsfootball and further enhanced by muctebanesiri with RTL support and other features.

**Development transparency**: Almost all the enhancements and coding work for this multi-question version were accomplished by **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**. I currently don't have much knowledge in this domain, but wanted to create a more comprehensive multiple choice template for my Anki studies, and the AI helped transform the original single-question template into this enhanced multi-question version with improved visual feedback, better organization, and additional features.

### Backward Compatibility

If you are using the original template, you may need to first rename existing fields and add new fields to your notes manually, then replace the original HTML and CSS code with the this version. While this approach should work in theory, I have not tested it extensively. **Make sure to back up your original template and notes before making any changes**.

**Migration steps (untested):**
1. Back up your current template and notes
2. Rename existing fields to match the new field structure
3. Add the additional fields for multi-question support
4. Replace the template code with the enhanced versions

If you successfully migrate from the original template, please consider sharing your experience to help improve these instructions.
